# First Projects

Welcome to the **First Projects** repository! This repository is a collection of simple, beginner-friendly projects designed to help developers understand fundamental programming concepts. Each project focuses on a specific skill or idea and serves as a stepping stone to more advanced development.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Provide a starting point for anyone new to coding.
- Demonstrate simple projects in different programming languages.
- Offer inspiration and examples for small, manageable projects.

## Projects

### 1. **Number Guessing Game** (Python)
- **Description**: A console-based game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The program provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low.

  - User input and output
  - Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- **How to Run**:
  - Install Python (if not already installed).
  - Run the script using the command:
    ```bash
    python number_guessing.py
    ```

### 2. **Hangman Game** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Description**: A classic word-guessing game where players try to guess letters in a hidden word. Each incorrect guess adds a part to the hangman. The game ends when the word is guessed or the hangman is complete.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Web development basics: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - DOM manipulation and event handling.
  - Simple game logic and user interaction.
- **How to Play**:
  - Open the `hangman.html` file in a web browser.
